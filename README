This sample application is the a Java re-make of the simple receipt tracking 
software I wrote to manage my famliy budget while I was getting out of debt.
It allows for entry of expenses and displays some simple metrics about 
month-to-date progress of expenses vs. budgeted amounts. 

I kept the data model for the application extremely simple to avoid 
over-complicating my code sample.  In order to showcase my data modelling 
ability, I have concieved of a fictional Coupon Management System, which
houses data about coupon discounts for a retailer.  
In this system, the coupons can be targeted to specific merchandise 
or sales channels.  The use of the coupon may also be restricted 
including making coupons good only for a single use, or a single day.
